This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on the MNIST training dataset and evaluated on the MNIST test dataset.

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/MNIST-CNN-Classifier.git
cd MNIST-CNN-Classifier

Install the required dependencies:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib

Run the main script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize predictions:

Copy code
python main.py

The script will train the model for 9 epochs, evaluate its performance on the test set, and display a 10x10 grid of test images with predicted and true labels.
